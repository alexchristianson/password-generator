 ## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an application that a user can use to generate random password to provide greater security. 

## Description
After clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user can select what criteria they want their new password to meet such as length and what type(s) of characters they desire. Then their new password is presented to them within a large box in the middle of the page.
